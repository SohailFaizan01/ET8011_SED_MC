#################################### Main Choices ####################################

Amplifier Type:
 - Current to voltage. To avoid non-linearity of the input ESD protection (TVS Diode), a current input is required. The output is voltage as that will be read out by the spectrum analyser

Input/Output Impedances:
 - As the input type is current, the input impedance needs to approach 0 Ohm
 - In order to minimize reflections and maximize power transfer, 50 Ohm output impedance is required.

 	Implementation: The general controller will satisfy this if it has high enough gain, then it will act as an virtual ground.
 			Brute force for simplicity, it remains to be validated if this is an issue with noise requirements

Feedback Structure:
 - Passive integrating feedback structure, to compensate the differentiated input signal.
	Implementation: Capacitor 

Controller:
 - Two stage design in order to obtain enough loop gain, one stage does not have enough output impedance (50 Ohms). Furthermore, class AB output to reduce power consumption
	Options:
	 - Input
		- Cs stage: Inverting stage, will cause a positive feedback loop with the output stage :/
		- Cd stage: Does not have enough gain
		- Cg stage: Loads the input
		- Differential pair: Has gain and does not load the input, has higher noise.

	 - Output
		- Complementary Parallel: It has gain and low power
		- Antiparallel (Cs-Cd stage): not good because no gain and the first stage needs full swing, thus contributing to non linearity
 
	implementation: Differential input stage, with complementary parallel output stage

		Differential Input Stage:
			- NMOS instead of PMOS because it can be made smaller

Noise:
 - First stage is dominant in terms of noise as the noise of the second stage gets divided by the gain of the first stage.
 - Increase W of S1 until noise spec is met. Current should be increased to maintain IC, and thereby Ft.


Drive Capability:
 - First stage drive capability is equal to the gate current of the second stage.

 - Second stage determines the main drive capability as it is connected directly to the output.
 - 1mW into 50 Ohms => 0.2236V This is doubled to account for  50 Ohms output impedance => 0.4472V => 4,5 mA drive capability


Transfer:
 - Input = max 0.25V , Output = max 0,4472V => Gain = 1.788 => Cfb = 0.56*Cs
 - Vo = 2*(P*R)^0.5


Distortion/Non Linearity:


Biasing:

 - Loop gain reference selection: Set Cd to 0 
 - Current for stage 1 is determined by the noise spec, current for the second stage is determined by non linearity and drive capability

#################################### General Questions ####################################

 - Which stage is responsible for which pole in the loopgain graph?



#################################### Frequency Compensation ####################################
 - Phantom zero: not possible due to capacitive feedback
 - Pole Splitting /  / Resistive broad banding, will only move the poles further apart
