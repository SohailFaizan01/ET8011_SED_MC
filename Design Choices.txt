Amplifier Type:
 - Current to voltage. To avoid non-linearity of the input ESD protection (TVS Diode), a current input is required. The output is voltage as that will be read out by the spectrum analyser

Input/Output Impedances:
 - As the input type is current, the input impedance needs to approach 0 Ohm
 - In order to minimize reflections and maximize power transfer, 50 Ohm output impedance is required.

 	Implementation: The general controller will satisfy this if it has high enough gain, then it will act as an virtual ground.
 			Brute force for simplicity, it remains to be validated if this is an issue with noise requirements

Feedback Structure:
 - Passive integrating feedback structure, to compensate the differentiated input signal.
	Implementation: Capacitor 

Controller:
 - Two stage design in order to obtain enough loop gain, one stage does not have enough output impedance (50 Ohms). Furthermore, class AB output to reduce power consumption
	Options:
	 - Input
		- Cs stage: Inverting stage, will cause a positive feedback loop with the output stage :/
		- Cd stage: Does not have enough gain
		- Cg stage: Loads the input
		- Differential pair: Has gain and does not load the input, has higher noise.

	 - Output
		- Complementary Parallel: It has gain and low power
		- Antiparallel (Cs-Cd stage): not good because no gain and the first stage needs full swing, thus contributing to non linearity
 
	implementation: Differential input stage, with complementary parallel output stage

		Differential Input Stage:
			- NMOS instead of PMOS because...
			- Connection open because...

		Complementary Parallel:
			-

Other:
 - Loop gain reference selection: Set Cd to 0 

 - output stage current 

- Current for stage 1 is determined by the noise spec, current for the second stage is determined by non linearity and drive capability
